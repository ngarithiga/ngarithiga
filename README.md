Hi, I’m Benson Thiga
I have a deep passion for anything techy—if it’s got gears, code, or circuits, I’m in!
I’m currently navigating the exciting world of Mechanical Engineering (basically, I build cool stuff).
I’m looking to collaborate on creative projects that push boundaries and spark innovation.
You can reach me at thigabenson8@gmail.com—let’s create something awesome!
Pronouns: he/him
Fun fact: Did you know the iconic Lamborghini brand exists because the founder, Ferruccio Lamborghini, was unhappy with a Ferrari? Talk about turning frustration into horsepower!
